# Forecasting-sales-project
Developed a reliable sales forecasting model for liquor data. Our project analyzed liquor sales data from 2015 to 2018 to identify trends, correlations, and key factors influencing sales. Random Forest Regressor proved to be the best model, achieving a MAE of 1.36 and RÂ² Score of 0.99, making it highly accurate in predicting sales.
